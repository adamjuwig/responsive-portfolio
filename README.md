# Responsive Portfolio

For this project, the objective was to build a three page responsive website utilizing the CSS Bootstrap grid system, Bootstrap components and semantic HTML.

Navigation throughout the website is used by implimenting the Bootstrap <navbar> component, which is nested inside of the <header> tags. When the screen is scaled down to a medium size screen and smaller, the menu becomes responsive by collapsing into a hamburger style menu. The layout of the page is responsive without the use of media queries by usage of the Bootstrap row and column system. CSS is applied throughout the website, creating a clean and appealing layout. The bulk of the content falls within the <section> tags. For the index file, the content responds to a 2 column grid when scaled down to an extra small screen. On the portfolio page, the content scales down to a four column grid when scaled to a small screen. This modifies the images to stack on top of one another when scaling down to a small or extra small screen. On the contact page, the form component is pulled from Bootstrap which is nested inside of a row and colum group which renders to fit the entire screen when scaled to an extra small screen.
